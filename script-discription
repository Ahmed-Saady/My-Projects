1- How does the script handle options:


# It checks the initial arguments for -n, -v, or a combination like -vn/-nv.

# It then removes the options from the argument list, leaving the search string and filename.

# After that, it performs the search based on the flags that were set.

---------------------------------------------------------

2- If we wanted to add support for regex or additional options like -i, -c, -l, how would the structure change:

We could switch from using a simple while/case to parsing optionsm,  We would support regex by using grep -E.

# we can pass the options directly to grep.

# The -i option is already covered as we use grep -i.

# For -c (counting matching lines), we would introduce a counter variable.

# For -l (displaying only the filename if thereâ€™s a match)


--------------------------------------------------


3- What was the hardest part to implement:


# Read the file and search in it
